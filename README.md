1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The driverpass project was an excersize in working with a client to develop a system that matched their desired specifications. 
They wanted a web-based system that users could purchase traiing packages, check their progress, manage their information, and reserve training.
DriverPass is a driver training company that you can book training with to learn how to drive and to practice driving with na instructor. 

2. What did you do particularly well?
I think I did a good job of translating the customer's requirments into a list of things that were needed within the system. 
I also think I did a good job of creating various diagrams to outline different system functions as well as outlining the timeline for the project and the division of responsibilities.

3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think I did a prettygood job, but in one of the projects, I forgot to complete a section about the UI design. I would definitely want to
make sure that my work is complete so that the design document actually reflects the full picture of the design. An incomplete design document is not helpful.

4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I made sore to note down each thing the user would do in the system in the system, then I considered the technical aspects of these various needs and tried to come up
with the best way to put these needs in practice. It is important to consider the user's needs because they are the ones who will be using the system. They need to be able to use
the system easily, and they need to be able to do everything that they should be able to do to interact with the busuness.

5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I think the iterative design process is helpful to developing a clear picture of the software diesgn. In the future, I would use the various chart and diagram techniques
the we learned in this course to help me create and analyze system designs.
